"""Post per-host converge-freshness telemetry to Splunk HEC at end of run.

Why a callback and not a play: a terminal play cannot distinguish a host that
genuinely converged from a host whose failure was swallowed by a
block/rescue isolation pattern, and it has no access to per-host result
counts. This callback reads Ansible's own end-of-run ``stats`` object, so the
success verdict it publishes is derived from the executor's counters rather
than from anything a play could assert about itself.

    short_description: Ship per-host converge-freshness events to Splunk HEC
    description:
      - Emits one C(ansible:converge) event per host processed by the run,
        carrying the host FQDN, playbook name, repository git SHA and the
        per-host ok/changed/failed/unreachable/rescued counters.
      - Emits one C(ansible:converge:roster) event per inventory host so a
        Splunk alert can detect hosts that exist in inventory but have never
        reported a converge (orphans).
      - Inert unless the converging playbook publishes its configuration with
        C(ansible.builtin.set_stats) under the C(converge_telemetry) key, so
        enabling the plugin globally does not make unrelated playbooks emit.
      - Inert in check mode. A dry run changes nothing on the targets, so
        publishing a C(success) event for it would refresh the freshness clock
        of a host that was never actually converged — exactly the staleness the
        downstream alert exists to detect.

      - Splunk HEC endpoint reachable from the control node
