"""Pure event construction for the converge-telemetry callback.

Split from converge_telemetry.py, which holds only the callback lifecycle.
These are ordinary functions over plain dicts with no Ansible callback state,

is "what does a converge publish", not "when does it publish".

Shared by every consumer of the dryvist.homelab collection, so nothing here
names one consuming repository. The event source is `config["repo"]`,
published by the converging playbook alongside `git_sha` -- see
